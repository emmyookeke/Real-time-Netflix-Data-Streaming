# REAL-TIME NETFLIX DATA STREAMING ON AWS USING APACHE KAFKA, ZOOKEEPER  AND FLASK

Implementing a real-time data streaming solution for Netflix data on Amazon Web Services (AWS) through the utilization of Apache Kafka, Zookeeper and Flask interface presents an exciting and complex endeavor for group diving into the world of big data and cloud computing. Apache Kafka serves as the backbone of this streaming architecture, acting as a distributed streaming platform capable of handling vast amounts of data in real-time. 

The project aims to leverage cutting-edge technologies, enhancing both technical proficiency and the ability to address the growing demand for real-time analytics in the streaming industry. By leveraging Flask for the user interface, this project will not only ensure technical proficiency but also market differentiation and strategic growth opportunities.
