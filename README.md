# REAL-TIME NETFLIX DATA STREAMING ON AWS USING APACHE KAFKA, ZOOKEEPER  AND FLASK
This project aims to implement a real-time data streaming solution for Netflix data on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Apache Kafka, Zookeeper, and Flask interface. The goal is to leverage cutting-edge technologies to enhance technical proficiency and address the growing demand for real-time analytics in the streaming industry.

# Project Overview
The project involves setting up a real-time data streaming architecture on AWS, with Apache Kafka serving as the backbone for handling vast amounts of streaming data. Zookeeper is used for coordination and management within the Kafka ecosystem, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. Additionally, Flask is employed to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the streaming platform.

# Key Components
# Apache Kafka
Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that provides real-time data pipelines and event streaming capabilities. It allows for the ingestion, processing, and analysis of streaming data at scale.

# Zookeeper
Zookeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and group services. It is used in Kafka for managing and coordinating Kafka brokers, ensuring high availability and reliability.

# Flask
Flask is a lightweight web application framework written in Python. It is used to develop the user interface for interacting with the real-time streaming platform. Flask provides flexibility and ease of development for creating web-based applications.

# Project Objectives
Set up Apache Kafka and Zookeeper clusters on AWS.
Develop a Flask-based user interface for interacting with the streaming platform.
Ingest Netflix data streams into Kafka topics.
Implement real-time data processing and analytics using Kafka Streams.
Display streaming analytics results on the Flask interface.

# Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
Set up an AWS account and provision the necessary resources (EC2 instances, S3 buckets, etc.).
Install Apache Kafka and Zookeeper on the AWS EC2 instances.
Create a Flask application and define routes for interacting with the Kafka streams.
Ingest Netflix data streams into Kafka topics using Kafka producers.
Implement real-time data processing and analytics using Kafka Streams.
Display streaming analytics results on the Flask interface.
